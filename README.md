This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## X (Twitter) API Setup

To enable fetching posts from X in development:

1. Create a developer account and app on X. Generate a Bearer Token for App-only auth.
2. Add the token to your environment (one of the following):

```bash
# preferred
export X_BEARER_TOKEN="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"

# fallback supported by the helper
export TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN"
```

3. Restart the dev server. Then test the API route:

```
GET http://localhost:3000/api/x/posts?username=jack&max_results=20
```

It returns the user object and recent tweets (excluding replies). This will be used to compute and plot IQ scores.
